Worker process to look after the Academic Database.

- Sits in a separate database [AcademicController]
- Runs a periodic CLR to see if a new version of MAG has been published

When a new version of MAG has been published:
- Delete previously downloaded files and the old version of Academic (not the one currently live, but the previous version)
- Trigger CLR to download data (will take up to a day)
- Create SearchText and unindex the Abstracts
- Create database with name = current MAG
- Create tables
- Upload data to new DB
- Update tables to create / enter data for calculated fields (SearchText, Abstracts, +)
- Create indexes
- Create authorsdata table AFTER indexes, so the update can use the indexes
- Run classifiers (i.e. RCT Classifier)
- Update Controller stored procedures so that they point to the new database
- Tell EPPI-Reviewer that a new MAG database is available
