"3273","1","1 Silencing distressed children in the context of war in northern Uganda: An analysis of its dynamics and its health consequences.","Children in northern Uganda who are the focus of this article were born and raised in the context of war. The research presented here is based on a one-year ethnographic study (2004-2005) with children aged 9-16 years. Various qualitative and quantitative methods used in this study were geared to this age group. A grounded theory approach was followed to trace the reasons for the silencing of their distress. Throughout the study a child actor perspective was implemented: children were approached as social actors capable of processing social experience and devising ways of coping with life. We found that their lives were characterized by high rates of exposure to extreme events  such as deaths  child abductions  disease epidemics  gender-based violence and poverty. As a consequence  their level of emotional distress was high. However  they did not readily speak about their distress. The article identifies and analyses a complex set of reasons for children s distress and its silencing by the children themselves and other members of society. A distinction is made between the processes of victim blaming  self blaming  mimetic resilience and mirroring resilience. In addition  the consequences of the silencing children are presented. Children expressed their emotional suffering primarily in physical aches and pains and used pharmaceuticals and herbal medicines to minimize their distress. The result was a medicalization of psychological distress. In conclusion  we reflect on the necessity of a multi-pronged approach to address children s distress.",""
"226969","1","The natural history of bacterial colonization of the newborn in a maternity hospital (Part II).","The object of this study was to determine the sources from which the newborn infant derives his bacterial flora during the first 5 days after birth. Detailed bacteriological data was obtained from 193 mothers antenatally and during labour  and from their infants on the day of birth and on Day 5. Organisms were typed by appropriate methods and the 193 mother-baby pairs declared to be a  match  or a  non-match  according as to whether or not identical bacteria were isolated from both members of the pair. Weekly swabs from hands and noses of staff were taken throughout the 12 months of the study. Swabs were also taken from the environment and air samples from different areas in the hospital. In approximately one third of infants the colonizing bacteria are derived from their mothers  in over 70 per cent of instances from the mother s rectum. The mother s birth canal is not a common source of bacteria and there is no direct relationship with the noses or hands of staff. Artificial feeds are not a source of the colonizing bacteria. The overall distribution of the bacterial species in the infants differed from that found in the hospital environment but this does  none the less  constitute a reservoir of bacteria which is being continually replenished from human sources. Pathogens such as Staph  aureus and Strep. pyogenes are no longer commonly found in newborn infants in the modern maternity hospital  but the need for continual vigilance and an efficient bacteriological service in all maternity units has been in no way diminished.",""
"1604236","1","Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis.","The  core deficit  of dyslexia has been characterized by different researchers in terms of either phonological impairments or of difficulties in processing basic visual and auditory stimuli. Recent findings suggest that a single type of impairment in the dynamics of perception  which affects the efficiency of short-term memory  might underlie the broad range of difficulties of dyslexics. Experimental findings show that the general population quickly and automatically tunes around incoming stimuli   anchors to them  and performs faster and more accurately when these stimuli are subsequently repeated. Dyslexic individuals fail to benefit from stimulus-specific repetitions. This deficit can account for phonological  working memory  visual and auditory difficulties  in addition to the greater sensitivity of dyslexics to external noise.",""
