AB  - Objective: Depressive disorders are of great medical and political significance. Although evidence-based guidelines have been published and educational initiatives have been launched to implement them, they are rarely actually used. The aim of the study was to implement clinical practice guidelines for outpatient care of depression using a practice-oriented and interdisciplinary approach. Design: Controlled clinical trial with a naturalistic design (data collection within routine practice) designed as a prospective pre-post study. Setting: Outpatient care. Participants: 29 general practitioners (intervention: 18; control: 11) and 15 psychiatrists (intervention: 11; control: 4). Overall, the treatment of 698 patients (two samples: pre: 361; post: 337) was documented. Intervention(s): Multifaceted intervention combining benchmarking, continuous medical education and interdisciplinary quality circles for the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders. Main outcome measures: Mixed-effects regression models for cluster-adjusted analysis of patients’ symptom reduction. Results: Although physicians in the intervention group improved their clinical effectiveness (proportion of patients with response/remission) to a greater extent than physicians in the control group (intervention: 48.6% to 66.9%; control: 54.9% to 61.5%), cluster-adjusted analysis failed to prove a statistically significant effect of the intervention on the treatment outcome. Conclusions: Although no statistically significant improvements were found regarding the outcomes, the action programme provides important work, materials and results for an integrated treatment model for depression.

AB  - Sickness leave is a major source of societal costs in depression treatment. However, very little is known about the rationale behind sick leave and their effects on depressive symptoms. Aim of the paper is to evaluate the effect of sick leave on treatment outcome and the association of sick leave with patient, depression and treatment-related factors. For this we compared patients with sick leave and non-sick leave regarding symptom reduction following 6 weeks of treatment. A total of 118 patients of 41 physicians in a controlled clinical trial with a naturalistic prospective design were analysed. After 8 weeks of treatment no significant differences were found between patients who had or did not have sick leave, in terms of improvement of depressive symptoms. The analyses of physician, patient and illness-related variables regarding their predictive value showed no significant effect. No systematic effect of sick leave and no clear criteria were found that were related to receiving a sick leave certificate. It can be assumed that physicians do not only base the decision of whether to sign a depressive patient off sick on illness-specific factors. For a targeted implementation of sick leave as therapeutic measure predictors for effectiveness should be defined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - The article focuses on a controlled study to evaluate an Internet-delivered self-help programme with minimal therapist contact for people suffering mild or moderate depression. The study was based on data from 85 self-recruited participants (out of 117 applicants) who were randomized to either treatment via the Internet (n=36) or to a waiting-list control condition (n=49). The self-help programme was based on cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) and included components such as psycho-education, behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, sleep/physical health and relapse prevention. The pre- and post-treatment forms used to measure depression were the Beck Depression Inventory and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The participants improved significantly on both measures of depression compared with the waiting list control group. The findings suggest that Internet-based self-help can have positive effects on mild to moderate depression, and is more easily administered, as well as more effective in terms of both time and cost, than traditional CBT.

AB  - Objectives: To explore to what extent psychological factors such as expectation, depression, anxiety and belief in alternative medicine impact placebo response and differential responses to separate placebo interventions. Methods: We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the clinical response of two distinct placebo treatments (sham acupuncture device and placebo pill) in 119 participants with persistent distal upper arm pain due to repetitive stress injury. We used a multivariable linear regression model to identify potential correlates of self reported upper extremity pain at the end of treatment in both placebo arms of the study combined. We also performed stratified analyses by placebo treatment. Results: We did not find any of the psychological factors of interest to be associated with pain at the end of treatment in our combined analysis. We found higher baseline pain score and pain for longer than 1 year’s duration to be significantly associated with higher pain scores at the end of treatment for the placebo treatments combined. In stratified analyses, for the sham acupuncture group, we found higher baseline depression score, higher baseline pain score and younger age to be independently correlated with higher pain score at the end of treatment. For the placebo pill group, only baseline pain was significantly correlated to pain score at the end of treatment. Conclusion: In this trial, neither expectancy nor psychological states were associated with response to placebo, with the exception of baseline depression score for the sham acupuncture arm.

AB  - Studied the effectiveness of cognitive–behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression in 21 male and female adults (aged 18–65 yrs) with major depression diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria. Data on sociodemographic variables and clinical and psychological symptoms were obtained by questionnaire. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II) (Spanish version by A. Ávila-Espada and F. Jiménez Gómez, 1988) and the Suggestibility Scale (E. García-Cueto and Gordon, 1998) were used. Ss received cognitive–behavioral alone or in combination with relaxation training or hypnosis during 12 weekly sessions. The results indicate that cognitive–behavioral therapy is more effective when applied under hypnosis conditions than alone or under relaxation conditions.

AB  - Depression is a common and important disorder in later life. Yet there are concerns about the recognition and treatment of patients with major depressive disorder in general practice. Interventions incorporated in disease management programmes that are aimed at improving screening, diagnosis and treatment might be of benefit to the outcomes for elderly patients. A randomized, controlled trial that compared the effects of an intervention programme aiming to improve the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of depression in elderly patients with care as usual was performed in The Netherlands. The 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) was used for screening and the mood module of the PRIMary care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) was used for diagnosis. In total 43 general practitioners (GPs) from 34 practices were willing to participate. Eighteen practices (23 GPs) were allocated to the intervention group and 16 practices (20 GPs) were allocated to the care as usual group. The GPs in the intervention group were trained in consecutive training sessions that were repeated once. Practice assistants in both groups were trained in carrying out the screening. Some 4000 patients over 55 years of age were screened in the practices from June 2000 to October... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess whether a cut-off of five on the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) that was determined beforehand yielded the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of major depression in the elderly in primary care. A sample of 330 patients was drawn from a group of elderly patients (≥ 55 years) that participated in a clinical trial, the West-Friesland Study (WFS). The mood-module of the PRIMary care Evaluation of Mental Disorder (PRIME-MD) served as the external criterion for major depression. The results showed that using a ROC-curve the best cut-off score of the GDS-15 was five. This cut-off score gave a sensitivity of 0.79 and a specificity of 0.67 and a negative predictive value of 0.94. It is concluded that the validation in retrospect of the a priori chosen cut-off score of five in a sample of the study population supports our a priori choice.

AB  - Studied the psychosocial effects of interactive computer use as a means to communicate for social, functional, and/or health care purposes in a home health care setting. In a 3-mo randomized prospective trial, telecommunications terminals were installed in the private residences of computer-illiterate persons aged 65 yrs and older, providing visiting nurses the opportunity to teach computer use with 3 different training methods. the control group had similar weekly nurse visits, but no computer terminal use. Pre-posttests using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale compared change in self-esteem and depression scores of computer-use clients with the scores of the control group clients. Interactive computer use, alone, did not significantly change scores. Compared to the control group, however, these was a significant change toward improved self-esteem and depression when interactive computer use was accompanied with weekly nurse computer training. Weekly training with a significant other, as a substitute for the nurse trainer, significantly improved self-esteem scores but not depression scores.

AB  - Objective: Although emerging data indicate that sample composition may influence the effectiveness of mental health interventions, the extent to which subjects in clinical trials represent affected community samples remains unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the proportion of community-dwelling adults with major depressive episode (MDE) who would meet eligibility criteria for a traditional efficacy trial in patients with MDE. Method: We applied a standard set of exclusion criteria used in clinical trials in patients with MDE to the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey for Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), the largest psychiatric epidemiologic study in the United States to date (N = 43,093). Because individuals who seek treatment for a disorder may systematically differ from those who do not, we applied the criteria first to all individuals with a current diagnosis of MDE (N = 3119) (diagnosed according to DSM-IV) and then to the subsample of individuals who sought treatment (N = 1359). Results: Among the full sample of individuals with MDE, 75.8% were excluded by one or more study eligibility criteria. Approximately two thirds (66.9%) of the sub sample of those who sought treatment were excluded. The percentage of subjects excluded by individual study criteria ranged from 2.4% to 47.4% in the overall sample and 0% to 38.4% in the treatment-seeking sample. For both groups, the presence of comorbid, non depressive, non-substance use Axis I disorders and the duration of the depressive episode excluded the largest percentage of individuals. Conclusion: The design of traditional clinical trials tends to exclude a majority of individuals with MDE. Selection of exclusion criteria may have a powerful influence on the generalizability of study results. Clinical trials should explain the rationale for their exclusion criteria and estimate the impact of eligibility criteria on the generalizability of trial results.

AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acid (FA) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in order to determine efficacy and to examine sources of heterogeneity between trials. PubMed (1965-May 2010) was searched for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of omega-3 FAs for MDD. Our primary outcome measure was standardized mean difference in a clinical measure of depression severity. In stratified meta-analysis, we examined the effects of trial duration, trial methodological quality, baseline depression severity, diagnostic indication, dose of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in omega-3 preparations, and whether omega-3 FA was given as monotherapy or augmentation. In 13 randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the efficacy of omega-3 FAs involving 731 participants, meta-analysis demonstrated no significant benefit of omega-3 FA treatment compared with placebo (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.04, 0.26). Meta-analysis demonstrated significant heterogeneity and publication bias. Nearly all evidence of omega-3 benefit was removed after adjusting for publication bias using the trim-and-fill method (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI: −0.13, 0.15). Secondary analyses suggested a trend toward increased efficacy of omega-3 FAs in trials of lower methodological quality, trials of shorter duration, trials which utilized completers rather than intention-to-treat analysis, and trials in which study participants had greater baseline depression severity. Current published trials suggest a small, non-significant benefit of omega-3 FAs for major depression. Nearly all of the treatment efficacy observed in the published literature may be attributable to publication bias. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Background: Prediction of treatment outcome has important clinical consequences. Personality factors have rarely been tested as predictors of acute outcome. Personality, demographic and illness-related characteristics were assessed at baseline for prediction of outcome of treatment in depressed out-patients. Methods: One hundred and ninety-three patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in a 12 to 16 week trial. The treatment consisted of nefazodone, nefazodone in combination with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), IPT in combination with placebo and IPT alone. Demographic and illness related variables were collected at baseline. Personality was assessed using the NEO-FFI. This instrument measures five dimensions of personality. A hierarchical logistic regression was carried out to test for significant predictors of remittance. Further a multiple regression analysis was used to investigate variables predictive of changes on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as dependent variable. Results: Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship of outcome with severity, duration of index episode, and use of medical services (UMS). None of the personality variables was predictive of outcome. Regression analyses showed that these disease related variables each uniquely predicted outcome, but that personality factors did not significantly contribute to the prediction model. Limitations: The study was carried out in secondary and tertiary care centers and may not be generalizable to other populations. Personality dimensions were assessed with a self-report instrument and may be prone to bias. Conclusions: Severity and duration of the index episode, and to a lesser extent, UMS, and not personality factors, predict outcome in the short term treatment of MDD.

AB  - Objectives: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has demonstrated some efficacy in treatment-resistant major depression (TRD). The majority of previous controlled studies have used anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a control location such as the supraorbital region for the cathode. Several open-label studies have suggested effectiveness from anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC combined with cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC. Thus, this study evaluated the efficacy of tDCS using anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC compared to sham tDCS. Methods: Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited from a tertiary care university hospital. Twenty-four subjects with TRD and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression greater than 21 were randomized to receive tDCS or sham tDCS.The rates of remission were compared between the two treatment groups. Results: The remission rates did not differ significantly between the two groups using an intention to treat analysis. More subjects in the active tDCS group had failed a course of electroconvulsive therapy in the current depressive episode. Side effects did not differ between the two groups and in general the treatment was very well tolerated. Conclusion: Anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC was not efficacious in TRD. However, a number of methodological limitations warrant caution in generalizing from this study. Ongoing, controlled studies should provide further clarification on the efficacy of this stimulation configuration in TRD.

AB  - Context: Depression is common in patients with cardiac disease, especially in patients with heart failure, and is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Some evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may reduce depressive symptoms, but to our knowledge the effects of exercise on depression in patients with heart failure have not been evaluated. Objective: To determine whether exercise training will result in greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared with usual care among patients with heart failure. Design, Setting and Participants: Multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving 2322 stable patients treated for heart failure at 82 medical clinical centers in the United States, Canada, and France. Patients who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or lower, had New York Heart Association class I to IV heart failure, and had completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score were randomized (1:1) between April 2003 and February 2007. Depressive scores ranged from 0 to 59; scores of 14 or higher are considered clinically significant. Interventions: Participants were randomized either to supervised aerobic exercise (goal of 90 min/wk for months 1-3 followed by home exercise with a goal of ≥120 min/wk for months 4-12) or to education and usual guideline-based heart failure care. Main Outcome Measures: Composite of death or hospitalization due to any cause and scores on the BDI-II at months 3 and 12. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 30 months, 789 patients (68%) died or were hospitalized in the usual care group compared with 759 (66%) in the aerobic exercise group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.99; P = .03). The median BDI-II score at study entry was 8, with 28% of the sample having BDI-II scores of 14 or higher. Compared with usual care, aerobic exercise resulted in lower mean BDI-II scores at 3 months (aerobic exercise, 8.95; 95% CI, 8.61 to 9.29 vs usual care, 9.70; 95% CI, 9.34 to 10.06; difference, −0.76; 95% CI, −1.22 to −0.29; P = .002) and at 12 months (aerobic exercise, 8.86; 95% CI, 8.67 to 9.24 vs usual care, 9.54; 95% CI, 9.15 to 9.92; difference, −0.68; 95% CI, −1.20 to −0.16; P = .01). Conclusions: Compared with guideline-based usual care, exercise training resulted in a modest reduction in depressive symptoms, although the clinical significance of this improvement is unknown.

AB  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to rank second on a list of 15 major diseases in terms of burden in 2030. The major contribution of MDD to disability and health care costs is largely due to its highly recurrent nature. Accordingly, efforts to reduce the disabling effects of this chronic condition should shift to preventing recurrence, especially in patients at high risk of recurrence. Given its high prevalence and the fact that interventions are necessary during the remitted phase, new approaches are needed to prevent relapse in depression. Methods/design: The best established effective and available psychological intervention is cognitive therapy. However, it is costly and not available for most patients. Therefore, we will compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-management supported by online CT accompanied by SMS based tele-monitoring of depressive symptomatology, i.e. Mobile Cognitive Therapy (M-CT) versus treatment as us usual (TAU). Remitted patients (n = 268) with at least two previous depressive episodes will be recruited and randomized over (1) M-CT in addition to TAU versus (2) TAU alone, with follow-ups at 3, 12, and 24 months. Randomization will be stratified for number of previous episodes and type of treatment as usual. Primary outcome is time until relapse/recurrence over 24 months using DSM-IV-TR criteria as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). For the economic evaluation the balance between costs and health outcomes will be compared across strategies using a societal perspective. Discussion: Internet-based interventions might be helpful in empowering patients to become their own disease managers in this lifelong recurrent disorder. This is, as far as we are aware of, the first study that examines the (cost) effectiveness of an E-mental health program using SMS monitoring of symptoms with therapist support to prevent relapse in remitted recurrently depressed patients.

AB  - This study was a clinical replication of the Peniston electroencephalographic biofeedback (EEG biofeedback) protocol for treating chemical dependency. This study involved a clinical trial with 16 chemically dependent subjects treated in a university-based outpatient clinic between 1993 and 1995. Pre-treatment Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores for the EEG biofeedback group were indicative of mild to moderate depression, but their post-treatment scores were significantly reduced to within the normal range. These results attest to the robust nature of EEG biofeedback for chemical dependency, even with subjects from the criminal justice population.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of treating depression with coping-oriented couples therapy (COCT) as compared with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; A. T. Beck, C. Ward, & M. Mendelson, 1961) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT; M. M. Weissman, J. C. Markowitz, & G. L. Klerman, 2000). Sixty couples, including 1 clinically depressed partner, completed pre- and posttest questionnaires as well as follow-up assessments at 6-month intervals over the subsequent 1.5 years. Effects of the 3 treatments on depressive symptomatology assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (A. T. Beck, A. J. Rush, B. L. Shaw, & G. Emery, 1979) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (M. Hamilton, 1960); recovery rates; and relapse rates were examined. Additionally, changes in relationship quality were evaluated. Results suggest that the COCT is as effective in improving depressive symptomatology as are the well-established, evidenced-based CBT and IPT approaches. The COCT did not demonstrate a significantly better outcome with regard to self-reported relationship satisfaction or dyadic coping; however, it did produce significant improvements in partners' expressed emotion, changes that were not seen in other treatment conditions.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of direct contact person-to-person prayer on depression, anxiety, positive emotions, and salivary cortisol levels. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-over clinical trial with depression or anxiety conducted in an office setting. Following randomization to the prayer intervention or control groups, subjects (95% women) completed Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety, Life Orientation Test, Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, and underwent measurement of cortisol levels. Individuals in the direct person-to-person prayer contact intervention group received six weekly 1-hour prayer sessions while those in the control group received none. Rating scales and cortisol levels were repeated for both groups after completion of the prayer sessions, and a month later. ANOVAs were used to compare pre- and post-prayer measures for each group. Results: At the completion of the trial, participants receiving the prayer intervention showed significant improvement of depression and anxiety, as well as increases of daily spiritual experiences and optimism compared to controls (p < 0.01 in all cases). Subjects in the prayer group maintained these significant improvements (p < 0.01 in all cases) for a duration of at least 1 month after the final prayer session. Participants in the control group did not show significant changes during the study. Cortisol levels did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups, or between pre- and post-prayer conditions. Conclusions: Direct contact person-to-person prayer may be useful as an adjunct to standard medical care for patients with depression and anxiety. Further research in this area is indicated.

AB  - Objective: To investigate whether the effect of direct contact person-to-person prayer on depression, anxiety, and positive emotions is maintained after 1 year. Design, Setting, and Participants: One-year follow-up of subjects with depression and anxiety who had undergone prayer intervention consisting of six weekly 1-hour prayer sessions conducted in an office setting. Subjects (44 women) completed Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety, Life Orientation Test, and Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale after finishing a series of six prayer sessions and then again a month later in an initial study. The current study reassessed those subjects with the same measures 1 year later. One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare findings pre-prayer, immediately following the six prayer sessions, and 1 month and again 1 year following prayer interventions. Results: Evaluations post-prayer at 1 month and 1 year showed significantly less depression and anxiety, more optimism, and greater levels of spiritual experience than did the baseline (pre-prayer) measures (p < 0.01 in all cases). Conclusions: Subjects maintained significant improvements for a duration of at least 1 year after the final prayer session. Direct person-to-person prayer may be useful as an adjunct to standard medical care for patients with depression and anxiety. Further research in this area is indicated.

AB  - Preliminary findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can have antidepressant effects. We sought to test this further in a parallel-group, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients with major depression, medication-free randomized into three groups of treatment: anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (active group—'DLPFC'); anodal tDCS of the occipital cortex (active control group—'occipital') and sham tDCS (placebo control group—'sham'). tDCS was applied for 10 sessions during a 2-wk period. Mood was evaluated by a blinded rater using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The treatment was well tolerated with minimal side-effects that were distributed equally across all treatment groups. We found significantly larger reductions in depression scores after DLPFC tDCS [HDRS reduction of 40.4% (±25.8%)] compared to occipital [HDRS reduction of 21.3% (±12.9%)] and sham tDCS [HDRS reduction of 10.4% (±36.6%)]. The beneficial effects of tDCS in the DLPFC group persisted for 1 month after the end of treatment. Our findings support further investigation on the effects of this novel potential therapeutic approach—tDCS—for the treatment of major depression.

AB  - Objective: The authors described the influence of specific medical conditions on clinical remission and response of major depression (MOD) in a clinical trial evaluating a care-management intervention among older primary-care patients. Methods: Adults age 60 years and older were randomly selected and screened for depression. Participants were randomly assigned to Usual Care or to an Intervention with a depression care-manager offering algorithm-based care for MDD. In all, 324 adults meeting criteria for MDD were included in these analyses. Remission and response was defined by a score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression <10 and by a decrease from baseline of ≥50%, respectively. Medical comorbidity was ascertained through self-report. Cognitive impairment was defined by a score <24 on the Mini- Mental State Exam (MMSE). Results: In Usual Care, rates of remission were faster in persons who reported atrial fibrillation (AF) than in persons who did not report AF and slower in persons who reported chronic pulmonary disease than in persons who did not report chronic pulmonary disease; rates of response were less stable in persons with MMSE <24 than in those with MMSE ≥24. In the Intervention condition, none of the specific chronic medical conditions were significantly associated with outcomes for MDD. Conclusions: Because disease-specific findings were observed in persons who received Usual Care but not in persons who received more intensive treatment in the Intervention condition, our results suggest that the association of medical comorbidity and treatment outcomes for MDD may be determined by the intensity of treatment for depression.

AB  - Objective: To describe the influence of domains of cognition on remission and response of depression in an intervention trial among older primary care patients. Methods: Twenty primary care practices were randomly assigned to Usual Care or to an Intervention consisting of a depression care manager offering algorithm-based care for depression. In all, 599 adults 60 years and older with a depression diagnosis were included in these analyses. Depression severity and remission of depression were assessed by the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was our global measure of cognitive function. Verbal memory was assessed with the memory subscale of the Dementia Rating Scale. Attention was measured with the digit span from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Test. Response inhibition, one of the executive functions, was assessed with the Stroop Color-Word test. Results: The intervention was associated with improved remission and response rates regardless of cognitive impairment. Response inhibition as measured by the Stroop Color-Word test appeared to significantly modify the intervention versus usual care difference in remission and response at 4 months. Patients in the poorest performance quartile at baseline on the Stroop Color-Word test in the Intervention Condition were more likely to achieve remission of depression at 4 months than comparable patients in Usual Care [odds ratio (OR) = 17.76, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 3.06, 103.1]. Conclusions: Depressed older adults in primary care with executive dysfunction have low remission and response rates when receiving usual care but benefit from depression care management.

AB  - Objective: The current study examined the efficacy of an early intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for depressive symptomatology. The ACT intervention is aimed at increasing the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions and living a mindful and value-based life. Method: Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to the ACT intervention (n = 49) or to a waiting list (n = 44). The mean age of the participants was 49 years. The majority of the participants was female and of Dutch origin. All the participants completed measures before and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS), alcohol use and acceptance (AAQ-II). Results: The ACT intervention led to statistically significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (Cohen’s d = .60). These reductions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Also significant reductions in anxiety and fatigue were observed. Moreover, mediational analysis showed that the improvement of acceptance during the intervention mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive symptomatology at follow-up. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an early intervention based on ACT, aimed at increasing acceptance, is effective in reducing depressive symptomatology.

AB  - Objective: Physical activity represents a promising treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). We conducted a single-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week physical activity counseling intervention delivered primarily by telephone (n = 44) to a wait-list control group (N = 48). Method: Ninety-two adults with MS and MDD or dysthymia (Mage = 48 years; 86% female, 92% White) completed an in-person baseline assessment and were randomized to wait-list control or an intervention involving motivational-interviewing-based promotion of physical activity. The treatment group received an initial in-person session; 7 telephone counseling sessions (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10), and an in-person session at Week 12. The primary outcome, treatment response, was defined as those with 50% or greater reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM–D) score. Results: Our primary hypothesis, that the proportion of responders in the treatment group would be significantly greater than in the control group, was not confirmed. However, compared with the control group, those in the treatment group evidenced significantly lower depression severity on the HAM–D, on self-reported depression, and on a measure of potential side effects and at 12 weeks were less likely to meet the criteria for MDD as set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.). Physical activity increased significantly more in the treatment condition, though it did not mediate improvement in depression severity. Conclusions: Telephone-based physical activity promotion represents a promising approach to treating MDD in MS. Further research is warranted on ways to bolster the impact of the intervention and on mediators of the treatment effect.

AB  - In rodents 5-hydroxytryptamine type 7 (5-HT7) receptor blockade has been shown to be effective in models of depression and to increase the latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decrease REM duration. In the clinic, the REM sleep reduction observed with many antidepressants may serve as a biomarker. We report here the preclinical and clinical evaluation of a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, (3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,4,5,6,7,8- hexahydro-1-(phenylmethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]azepine 2-hydroxy- 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate) (JNJ-18038683). In rodents, JNJ- 18038683 increased the latency to REM sleep and decreased REM duration, and this effect was maintained after repeated administration for 7 days. The compound was effective in the mouse tail suspension test. JNJ-18038683 enhanced serotonin transmission, antidepressant-like behavior, and REM sleep suppression induced by citalopram in rodents. In healthy human volunteers JNJ-18038683 prolonged REM latency and reduced REM sleep duration, demonstrating that the effect of 5-HT7 blockade on REM sleep translated from rodents to humans. Like in rats, JNJ-18038683 enhanced REM sleep suppression induced by citalopram in humans, although a drugdrug interaction could not be ruled out. In a double-blind, active, and placebo-controlled clinical trial in 225 patients suffering from major depressive disorder, neither treatment with pharmacologically active doses of JNJ-18038683 or escitalopram separated from placebo, indicating a failed study lacking assay sensitivity. Post hoc analyses using an enrichment window strategy, where all the efficacy data from sites with an implausible high placebo response [placebo group Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) < = 12] and from sites with no placebo response (MADRS > = 28) are removed, there was a clinically meaningful difference between JNJ-18038683 and placebo. Further clinical studies are required to characterize the potential antidepressant efficacy of JNJ-18038683. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Background: Time- and cost-effective self-rating scales of depressive symptoms are particularly valuable for frequent use in large-scale effectiveness trials. The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the French version of the self-rated Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S) and determine whether it might complement the MADRS in monitoring depression severity and change over time in routine clinical practice. Methods: Sixty-three adult outpatients with a current depressive episode completed the MADRS-S and were interviewed with the MADRS on two occasions, within a 1-month interval. Results: All patients readily accepted the MADRS-S. It showed good to excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.85 at Time 1; 0.94 at Time 2). Its factor structure revealed that a single component explained a large proportion of variability (47.0% at Time 1; 68.8% at Time 2). Concurrent validity of the self- and clinician-rated versions was good (Pearson's correlation coefficients for total scores 0.81 at Time 1; 0.91 at Time 2). The MADRS-S was sensitive to change over the 4-week observation period (correlation of 0.71 between change scores on self- and clinician-rated instruments). Limitations: Generalizability is restricted to outpatients with moderate to severe depression, and the MADRS-S ability to measure treatment effects needs to be examined. Conclusions: The present study indicates that the MADRS-S displays favourable psychometric properties and suggests that it might be a valid complement to the MADRS, both in research settings and clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Missing data are widespread in the medical sciences. Given their prevalence, researchers must be prepared to address problems that arise when data are missing. Objectives: The objectives were to (1) provide an estimate of bias for each imputation technique with known values from data engineered to be missing completely at random; (2) determine whether different Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale scores were obtained from item-mean, person-mean, regression, and hot-deck imputation techniques and whether they differed from the CES-D score obtained from complete cases; and (3) determine whether the variables that predicted the CES-D scores were the same for the complete cases and each of the 4 imputation techniques. Methods: Depressive symptoms were assessed in patients (N = 2,317) in an international clinical trial comparing high blood pressure treatments between April 1, 1999, and October 31, 1999. Patients were mailed surveys after randomization. Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D Scale. Respondents who completed all 20 items were compared with those who did not complete all 20 items, using independent t tests and chi-square. Z scores were used to determine CES-D mean differences, and multiple regression models were used to predict the CES-D scores for the 4 imputation techniques and the complete case data. Results: Imputed CES-D mean scores ranged from 14.58 to 14.68. The 4 imputed CES-D mean scores were consistently, but not significantly, higher than the complete case CES-D mean of 14.06. Imputed mean scores were similar to each other and the complete case mean score. Four regression models predicting the imputed CES-D scores yielded similar predictions. With the exception of sex, the same variables predicted the complete case CES-D and the imputed CES-D scores. Conclusions: All the imputed means were similar to the complete case mean, with the exception of the regression imputation. Imputing missing data did not significantly alter the conclusions regarding which factors were associated with variations in CES-D scores. Since imputation has the potential to increase statistical power, researchers dealing with missing CES-D scores should consider imputing missing data.

AB  - Objective: Various studies have tested psychological therapies in the treatment of depression in primary care. Yet, concerns over their clinical effectiveness, as compared to usual general practitioner (GP) care or treatment with antidepressants, have been raised. The present meta-analysis was aimed at assessing currently available evidence on the topic. Method: A systematic search of electronic databases identified 10 randomized controlled trials comparing psychological forms of intervention with either usual GP care or antidepressant medication for major depression. Meta-analytical procedures were used to examine the impact of psychological intervention in primary care on depression, as compared to usual GP care and antidepressant treatment. Results: The main analyses showed greater effectiveness of psychological intervention over usual GP care in both the short term [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.59 to -0.26, n=408] and long term (SMD=-0.30, 95% CI=-0.45 to -0.14, n=433). The heterogeneity test was not significant in the short term at the P<.05 level (df=5, P=.57, I2=0%), but it was significant in the long term (df=5, P=.004, I2=70.9%). The comparison between psychological forms of intervention and antidepressant medication yielded no effectiveness differences, for either the short term or the long term. Conclusions: Psychological forms of intervention are significantly linked to clinical improvement in depressive symptomatology and may be useful for supplementing usual GP care.

AB  - Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) effectively prevents relapse/recurrence in major depression. The ability to deploy and maintain attention on a particular focus is considered as a prerequisite for ‘mindful’, ‘metacognitive’ awareness, and hence crucial for therapy success. Accordingly, sustained concentration is the skill most extensively taught in MBCT. The goal of the present study was to test whether this ability increases after MBCT, as assumed. The late component of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an event-related brain potential (ERP), known to reflect the allocation of attentional resources, was used as the measure of concentration ability. In the main phase of the study, 91 recurrently depressed patients in remission were randomly assigned to eight-week treatment by either MBCT or waiting (WAIT for delayed MBCT). The CNV response to an auditory test stimulus was measured pre- and post-treatment in a ‘mindfulness task’, in which patients were instructed to focus on their breath, as taught in MBCT. The late CNV (LCNV) was increased only after MBCT (and not after WAIT). This result reflects patients' improved ability to shift their attention toward current moment experience and away from potentially depressogenic thinking or rumination during mild dysphoric states—a known risk factor for depressive relapse/recurrence.

AB  - Background: Low brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are observed in both depressed and diabetes patients. Animal research has shown that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increase BDNF levels. In this exploratory randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study in diabetes patients with major depression, we tested whether (a) omega- 3 ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) leads to increased serum BDNF levels and (b) whether changes in BDNF levels are associated with corresponding changes in depression. Methods: Patients received 1 g/day E-EPA (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12) for 12 weeks, in addition to ongoing antidepressant therapy. At baseline and 12-week follow-up, we determined serum BDNF levels and depression severity, using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Results: We found no effect of E-EPA on BDNF levels (t = –0.144, p = 0.887), and changes in BDNF levels and depression severity were not significantly associated (Spearman’s ρ = –0.115, p = 0.593). Conclusion: Our study does not provide evidence that supplementation with E-EPA improves BDNF levels in depressed diabetes patients already using antidepressants.

AB  - A case of a patient with comorbid schizophrenia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) who was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is presented. This treatment led to significant improvement of schizophrenic and depressive symptoms, with only a partial, albeit not trivial, effect on his cognitive functioning. These encouraging results of treatment of OSAS in schizophrenia with nCPAP suggest the need for further and more systematic investigation of sleep and its disorders in psychotic patients.

AB  - Objective: To investigate if treatment outcome for severely depressed patients depends on their baseline level of anxiety. Research design and methods:: Patients with a primary diagnosis of severe major depressive disorder (n = 459) were randomised to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with escitalopram (20 mg) or paroxetine (40 mg). Post hoc analyses of efficacy in patients with a baseline HAM-A total score ≤20 (n = 171) or >20 (n = 280) were based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (ITT, LOCF). Results: At week 24, the mean change from baseline in MADRS total scores was -24.2 for escitalopram-treated patients (n = 141) and -21.5 for paroxetine-treated patients (n = 139) (p < 0.05) in high baseline anxiety patients and the mean change from baseline in HAM-A total score was -17.4 (escitalopram) and -15.1 (paroxetine) (p < 0.05). When examining the proportion of complete remitters (CGI-S = 1) after 24 weeks of treatment, there was an increasing treatment difference as a function of baseline HAM-A total score in favour of escitalopram (ITT, LOCF). There was no treatment difference in the low baseline anxiety group. Significantly more patients (p < 0.01) withdrew from the paroxetine group (31%) than from the escitalopram group (17%), partly as the result of significantly more withdrawals due to AEs (p < 0.05). Incidence of AEs and withdrawals were not related to baseline anxiety and there were no significant differences in the incidence of individual AEs with escitalopram compared to paroxetine. Limitations: The post hoc nature of these analyses, the absence of placebo control group, and the requirement that patients should be suffering from severe depression, limit the generalisability of the results. Conclusion: Patients with severe depression together with comorbid anxiety symptoms responded significantly better to treatment with escitalopram 20 mg compared with paroxetine 40 mg. Contrary to paroxetine, escitalopram maintained its efficacy with increasing baseline anxiety levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Compared the cost effectiveness of general practitioner care and 2 general practice-based psychological therapies for depressed patients. A prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted with 464 patients presenting with depression or mixed anxiety and depression who received usual general practitioner care or up to 12 sessions of non-directive counselling or cognitive-behaviour therapy provided by therapists. The main outcome measures were Beck depression inventory scores, EuroQol measure of health related quality of life, direct treatment and non-treatment costs, and cost of lost production. At 4 months, both non-directive counselling and cognitive-behaviour therapy reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than usual general practitioner care. There was no significant difference in outcome between treatments at 12 months. There were no significant differences in direct costs, production losses, or societal costs between the 3 treatments at either 4 or 12 months. Within the constraints of available power, the data suggest that both brief psychological therapies may be significantly more cost effective than usual care in the short term, as benefit was gained with no significant difference in cost.

AB  - It has been proposed that the greater efficacy of bilateral (BL) over right unilateral (RUL) electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) at low stimulus intensity is due to differences in site of seizure initiation. It was hypothesized that focal prefrontal seizures are more common with BL than RUL administration. Records were reviewed of the 1,007 ECT treatments of 84 consecutive patients with major depressive disorder randomized to RUL or BL electrode placement. Eight events were identified in which there was an electroencephalographic seizure without motor manifestation. All of these events occurred at titration sessions and with BL stimuli (p = 0.002). These events were more likely to occur later in the course of treatment. The authors suggest that BL ECT may induce focal seizures in prefrontal areas and that these seizures are more likely to occur later in the treatment course.

AB  - rTMS is considered to be a putative treatment option for those depressive patients being refractory or intolerant to other antidepressant treatment forms. Overall, published studies show a significant reduction in depressive symptomatology due to rTMS, but the clinical significance of the therapeutic changes were only modest. Therefore, studies to optimize the efficacy of rTMS are necessary. In the Berlin Predictor Study rTMS treatment of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was performed in 70 patients of whom 21% showed an antidepressant response. Since individual clinical symptom clusters were of special interest, five clusters ore analyzed during course of the treatment. By using a logistic regression model it could be shown that beside general predictors like short duration of episode and low level of therapy resistance, especially motor retardation and sleep disturbances are clinical predictors for a response to rTMS.

AB  - This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) in the treatment of patients suffering from anxiety or depressive disorders, as compared with a control case sample composed of patients undergoing treatment as usual (TAU). Sixty patients with depressive or anxiety disorders according to DSM IV-TR were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (STPP) or control group for 12 months (T1). Primary outcome measures were the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP), and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale. Intention to treat analysis revealed that patients who received STPP showed significantly more improvements in comparison with those who were in the TAU group on Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale and IIP measures. This study offers evidence that STPP is an effective treatment for patients with anxiety or depressive disorders, and it could be more effective than TAU in improving interpersonal problems as measured by IIP.

AB  - Many depressed patients report intrusive and distressing memories of specific events in their lives. Where present, these memories are believed to act as a maintaining factor. A series of ten patients with major depressive disorder and intrusive memories, many of them reporting severe, chronic, or recurrent episodes of depression, were given an average of 8.1 sessions of imagery rescripting as a stand-alone treatment. Hierarchical linear modelling demonstrated large treatment effects that were well maintained at one year follow-up. Seven patients showed reliable improvement, and six patients clinically significant improvement. These gains were achieved entirely by working through patients' visual imagination and without verbal challenging of negative beliefs. Spontaneous changes in beliefs, rumination, and behaviour were nevertheless observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are areas of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including fluid attenuated inverse recovery sequences. Total and regional WMH burden (i.e., volume or severity) has been associated with myriad cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric conditions among older adults. In the current report, we illustrate two approaches to quantify periventricular, deep, and total WMH and examine their reliability and criterion validity among 28 elderly patients enrolled in a depression treatment trial. The first approach, an operator-driven quantitative approach, involves visual inspection of individual MRI scans and manual labeling using a three-step series of procedures. The second approach, a fully automated quantitative approach, uses a processing stream that involves image segmentation, voxel intensity thresholding, and seed growing to label WM Hand calculate their volume automatically. There was good agreement in WMH quantification between the two approaches (Cronbach's alpha values from 0.835 to 0.968). Further, severity of WMH was significantly associated with worse depression and increased age, and these associations did not differ significantly between the two quantification approaches. We provide evidence for good reliability and criterion validity for two approaches for WMH volume determination. The operator-driven approach may be better suited for smaller studies with highly trained raters, whereas the fully automated quantitative approach may be more appropriate for larger, high-throughput studies.

AB  - Background: The prevelance of depression in older people is high, treatment is inadequate, it creates a substantial burden and is a public health priority for which exercise has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. Aims: To estimate the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms among older people, and assess whether treatment effect varies depending on the depression criteria used to determine participant eligibility. Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of exercise for depression in older people. Results: Nine trials met the inclusion criteria and seven were meta-analysed. Exercise was associated with significantly lower depression severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) = −0.34, 95% CI −0.52 to −0.17), irrespective of whether participant eligibility was determined by clinical diagnosis (SMD = −0.38, 95% CI −0.67 to −0.10) or symptom checklist (SMD = −0.34, 95% CI −0.62 to −0.06). Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, for older people who present with clinically meaningful symptoms of depression, prescribing structured exercise tailored to individual ability will reduce depression severity.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of group exercise for residents in care homes. Design: Exploratory cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting: Five randomly selected care homes in South Birmingham, UK. Participants: Fifty-six care home residents (mean age 84.5, 71% female), 39 (70%) with cognitive impairments. Intervention: Two homes (n = 28) were randomized to group exercise held twice weekly for five weeks. The remaining three homes (n = 28) formed the control group and received usual care, with no person specifically responsible for exercise training. Outcome measures: Assessments were conducted at zero (pre-intervention), three (post-intervention) and six months (follow-up) using the Rivermead Mobility Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale or Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (depending on cognitive impairment). Adherence to group exercise and retention to the study were also documented. Results: No statistically significant improvements in mobility or depression were found in favor of group exercise. Retention to the study was high with 46 (82%) participants completing all assessments. Adherence to group exercise was somewhat lower with participants attending a mean of 3.61 out of 8.5 prescribed sessions (42.5%). Conclusions: Group exercise can be delivered to care home residents with reduced mobility but it is not suitable for residents with severe cognitive impairment. An estimated sample size of 240 participants would be required to detect a clinically significant difference in the Rivermead Mobility Index with 90% power.

AB  - Examined the relationship between age and outcome of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This was a naturalistic, prospective follow-up of 81 consecutive inpatients with primary major depression. ECT outcome was compared for 3 age groups—25–64 yrs, 65–74 yrs and 75–89 yrs—on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) and clinical outcome rating scale. Assessments were performed pre-ECT, immediately post-ECT, 1–3 yrs later and, for patients suspected of having dementia, 5 yrs later. At post-ECT and follow-up, improvement on HRSD and clinical outcome ratings were comparable for patients in the 3 age groups. Improvements on GAF were also comparable post-ECT, but not between post-ECT and follow-up. At follow-up, 35.7% of the oldest group had dementia. Importantly, patients who did and did not develop dementia were clinically indistinguishable prior to ECT. The number and severity of common adverse events were similar pre- and post-ECT and were not associated with age. Depressive outcome and adverse effects of ECT are largely independent of age. Older patients receiving ECT appear to have a higher risk of developing dementia, possibly underpinned by cerebrovascular disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the outcomes of 3 interventions for the management of dementia complicated by depression or psychosis: psychogeriatric case management, general practitioners with specialist psychogeriatric consultation, and standard care for nursing home residents. The sample for this 12-wk randomized controlled trial consisted of 86 subjects (Ss) with dementia from nursing homes, of whom 34 had depression, 33 had depression and psychosis, and 19 had psychosis. All Ss received full psychiatric assessments and physical examinations. Information was obtained from the Ss' families and nursing home staff. Depression and psychosis were assessed through questionnares. Data were obtained from nursing home records on prescription of psychotropic medication and demographic information. Results show that all 3 groups improved from pretreatment to posttreatment on depression scales for depression groups and psychosis scales for psychosis groups. Mode of management appeared to make no difference in rate or amount of improvement; neither of the treatment group-by-time interactions were significant. Neither use of antidepressants nor use of antipsychotics predicted depression or psychosis outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of a self-management program for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in reducing depressive symptoms. Design: Analysis of 6-month follow-up for a subset of participants in a randomized, controlled trial who were clinically depressed at baseline. Setting: University ophthalmology clinic. Participants: Thirty-two depressed older adult volunteers (mean age 81.5) with advanced AMD who had been randomized to a self-management program (n=12) or one of two control conditions (n=20). Subjects were included if at baseline they met criteria from the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Axis, I, Fourth Edition, Research Version, for major or minor depressive disorder with significant depressive symptoms (≥5 points) on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Intervention: AMD self-management program consisting of cognitive and behavioral elements including health education and enhancement of problem-solving skills. Measurements: Primary outcome measure was GDS-15. Secondary outcome measures included National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) and AMD Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. Results: At 6-month follow-up, the self-management group had a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms on the GDS-15 than the controls (P=.03). The mean reduction of 2.92 points in the self-management group was more than the 2-point change threshold considered to be clinically meaningful. Change on the NEI-VFQ was nonsignificant. Reduction in depressive symptoms was associated with greater self-efficacy in the self-management group. Conclusion: These findings may support the effectiveness of an AMD self-management program for depressed older adults with advanced vision loss from AMD.

AB  - Objective: In this Phase II trial, we evaluated a novel psychological treatment for depressed patients coping with the stresses of cancer. Effectiveness of a combined biobehavioral intervention (BBI) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) was studied. Method: Participants were 36 cancer survivors (mean age = 49 years; 88% Caucasian; 92% female) diagnosed with major depressive disorder. A single group pre–post design was used. Treatment consisted of up to 20 individual 75-min combined BBI/CBT sessions. Outcomes were change in interviewer (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; Williams, 1988) and self-rated depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory—Second Edition; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) as well as change in cancer relevant symptoms (Fatigue Symptom Inventory [Hann et al., 1998] and Brief Pain Questionnaire [Daut, Cleeland, & Flanery, 1983]) and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form–36; Ware et al., 1995). Mixed-effects modeling, a reliability change index, and generalized linear models were used. All analyses were intent-to-treat. Results: Depressive symptoms significantly improved. In addition, 19 of 21 study completers met criteria for remission. Significant improvements were also noted in fatigue and mental health quality of life. Both concurrent anxiety disorders and high levels of cancer stress (Impact of Events Scale; Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979) were each associated with beginning and concluding treatment with greater depressive symptoms. Conclusions: CBT components were successfully incorporated into a previously efficacious intervention for reducing cancer stress. The BBI/CBT intervention warrants further research in evaluating its efficacy compared with well-established treatments for depression.

AB  - The continued high prevalence of depression in the general population has been in part attributed to a reluctance to consult and also to the limited capacity of psychological therapy services. In a previous randomized controlled trial, self-referral day-long workshops, each for 25 people, offering a cognitive-behavioral therapy approach, seemed to be effective at 3-month follow-up [Brown et al., 2004]. In this study, both experimental group participants and waiting list control participants who went on to attend the workshops (n = 102) were followed up and 54.9% provided data after 2 years. The dropout mechanism was investigated and random effects models were used for all analyses. This is a naturalistic study that lacked a control group and had a relatively high attrition rate. The results nevertheless suggest that positive changes in depression, anxiety, distress, and self-esteem achieved at 3 months follow-up were largely maintained at 2 years for those who were "depressed" (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] scores of 14 and above). However, nondepressed (BDI scores below 14) did not show any significant change. The overall results of this naturalistic study indicate that a very brief, intensive, and large-scale intervention can largely maintain its effects for participants with depression over a 2-year period.

AB  - Objectives: Depression is known to be a major problem in cancer patients, and evidence is emerging about the importance of anxiety. Because the disorders are highly comorbid, we examined the relationship of anxiety and depression with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in cancer patients. Methods: Sample included 405 adult oncology patients participating in a randomized controlled trial of telecare management for pain and depression. This secondary cross-sectional analysis of baseline data examined independent and additive effects of anxiety and depression on HRQL, disability, and somatic symptom severity. Results: In 397 patients who screened positive for either pain or depression or both, 135 had comorbid anxiety and depression, 174 had depression but not anxiety, and 88 had neither. Differences existed across all nonphysical HRQL domains and were more pronounced incrementally across the three groups in the expected direction. In GLM modeling, anxiety and depression were each associated with all the domains when modeled separately (p < 0.0001). When modeled together, anxiety and depression had independent and additive effects on the mental health domains of HRQL and on somatic symptom burden. In other domains (vitality, perceived disability, overall quality of life, and general health perceptions), only depression had an effect. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression have strong and independent associations with mental health domains and somatic symptom burden in cancer patients. However, depression has a more pervasive association with multiple other domains of HRQL. Paying attention to both anxiety and depression may be particularly important when addressing mental health needs and somatic symptom distress.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of exercise to reduce depressive symptoms among cancer survivors. In addition, we examined the extent to which exercise dose and clinical characteristics of cancer survivors influence the relationship between exercise and reductions in depressive symptoms. Methods: We conducted a systematic search identifying randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions among adult cancer survivors, examining depressive symptoms as an outcome. We calculated effect sizes for each study and performed weighted multiple regression moderator analysis. Results: We identified 40 exercise interventions including 2,929 cancer survivors. Diverse groups of cancer survivors were examined in seven exercise interventions; breast cancer survivors were examined in 26; prostate cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma were examined in two; and colorectal cancer in one. Cancer survivors who completed an exercise intervention reduced depression more than controls, d + = −0.13 (95% CI: −0.26, −0.01). Increases in weekly volume of aerobic exercise reduced depressive symptoms in dose-response fashion (β = −0.24, p = 0.03), a pattern evident only in higher quality trials. Exercise reduced depressive symptoms most when exercise sessions were supervised (β = −0.26, p = 0.01) and when cancer survivors were between 47–62 yr (β = 0.27, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Exercise training provides a small overall reduction in depressive symptoms among cancer survivors but one that increased in dose-response fashion with weekly volume of aerobic exercise in high quality trials. Depressive symptoms were reduced to the greatest degree among breast cancer survivors, among cancer survivors aged between 47–62 yr, or when exercise sessions were supervised.

AB  - Presents initial outcomes from the multisite, randomized trial known as PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial). As studies show that the majority of older adults who die by suicide have seen their physician within months of their death, PROSPECT tested the impact of a primary care intervention on reducing major risk factors for suicide in late life. A two-stage, age-stratified (60-74, ≥75 years) depression screening of randomly sampled patients was performed. Patients who screened positive and a random sample of screened negative patients were included. This analysis included patients with a depression diagnosis (N=598). The primary care intervention was compared with usual care. Assessment of suicidal ideation and depression severity at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months were the main outcome measures. Results show that suicidal ideation rates declined faster in intervention patients. Among patients reporting suicidal ideation, resolution of ideation was also faster among intervention patients. Finally, intervention patients had a more favorable course of depression in degree and speed of symptom reduction. The effects on depression were not significant among patients with minor depression unless suicidal ideation was present. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether an educational intervention would improve depression assessment and appropriate referral. Secondary analyses tested whether referral led to depression improvement. Design: Training in the Assessment of Depression (TRIAD) was a three-group, nurse-randomized trial. Researchers interviewed randomly selected patients at baseline and 8 weeks. Setting: Three certified home healthcare agencies in Westchester County, New York. Participants: Fifty-three medical/surgical nurses were randomized within agency to three intervention groups: full, minimal, or control. Research contact with nurses' patients (aged >65; N = 477) yielded 256 (53.7%) enrolled subjects, 84 (17.6%) ineligibles, and 120 (25.2%) refusals; 233 of the 256 (87.1%) enrolled patients completed follow-up interviews. Intervention: Nurse training in clinically meaningful use of depression sections of Medicare's mandatory Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). Measurements: Nurse-assessed mood or anhedonia (OASIS) versus research assessments using the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Disorders (SCID); referrals for mental health evaluation (agency records), and depression severity (24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HDRS). Results: Referral rates for patients with (SCID) depressed mood or anhedonia (n = 75) varied according to nurse group: 50.0% full intervention, 18.5% minimal, 21.4% control (P = .047). Rates for nondepressed patients (n = 180) did not differ (4.9%, 2.0%, 5.8%, respectively; P = .60). In patients with major or minor depression (n = 37), referral was associated with symptom improvement. Change in HDRS was 5 points greater in referred patients than others (P = .04). Concordance between OASIS and SCID did not differ between intervention groups. Conclusion: TRIAD showed that training nurses to assess for depression using an approach developed in partnership with home healthcare agencies led to appropriate referral and care for depressed patients.

AB  - Background: To test whether receiving care from a health visitor (HV) trained in identification and psychological intervention methods prevents depression 6-18 months postnatally in women who are not depressed 6 weeks postnatally. Method: The study was a prospective cluster trial, randomized by GP practice, with follow-up for 18 months in 101 primary care teams in the Trent area of England. The participants were women scoring <12 on the postal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 6 weeks postnatally (1474 intervention and 767 control women). Intervention HVs (n = 89, 63 clusters) were trained in identifying depressive symptoms using the EPDS and face-to-face clinical assessment and in providing psychologically orientated sessions based on cognitive behavioral or person-centered principles. The control group comprised HVs (n = 49, 37 clusters) providing care as usual (CAU). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women scoring ≥12 on the EPDS at 6 months postnatally. Secondary outcomes were mean EPDS score, Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation—Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI-SF) scores at 6,12 and 18 months. Results: After adjusting for individual-level covariates, living alone, previous postnatal depression (PND), the presence of one or more adverse life events and the 6-week EPDS score, the odds ratio (OR) for EPDS ≥ 12 at 6 months was 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.97, p = 0.031] for the intervention group (IG) women compared with the control (CAU) group women. Two subgroups were formed by baseline severity: a ' subthreshold' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 6-11 (n = 999) and a 'lowest severity' subgroup with a 6-week EPDS score of 0-5 (n = 1242). There was no difference in psychological effectiveness by subgroup (interaction term: z = −0.28, p = 0.782). Conclusions: This study provides new evidence of a universal, enduring preventive effect for depression in women who screen negative for depression postnatally.

AB  - Background: Psychomotor disturbance is an essential feature of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and has been associated with impaired functioning on cognitively demanding tasks. Given the psychomotor demands required to navigate a motor vehicle and the disastrous effects of motor vehicles accidents, patients with MDD present a population of clinical interest. The goal of this investigation was to examine the association between MDD and driving ability assessed within a simulated driving paradigm. Methods: 18 outpatients currently meeting diagnostic criteria for MDD and 29 control participants completed four 30-min simulated driving trials at 10:00 am, 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm, and 4:00 pm. Participants also completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess for depression severity and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess for everyday sleepiness. Results: After controlling for age and sleepiness, the depressed sample exhibited slower steering reaction times across trials (p<.05) and an increased number of crashes across trials (p<.05) when compared to controls. These differences were characterized by a medium effect size. No significant time-of-day effects were found. Limitations: MDD patients were free of anti-depressant medication and findings may not generalize to medicated populations. Also, a rural highway driving route was used which may not generalize well to urban driving settings. Conclusions: Patients with untreated MDD demonstrate impaired simulated driving performance. Further research into whether these findings translate into on-the-road impairment is important for public health and safety.

AB  - The current study examined whether the personality traits of self-criticism or dependency moderated the effect of stressful life events on treatment response. Depressed outpatients (N = 113) were randomized to 16 weeks of cognitive–behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or antidepressant medication (ADM). Stressful life events were assessed with the Bedford College Life Events and Difficulties Schedule. Severe events reported during or immediately prior to treatment predicted poor response in the ADM condition but not in the psychotherapy conditions. In contrast, nonsevere life events experienced prior to onset predicted superior response to treatment. Further, self-criticism moderated the relation of severe life events to outcome across conditions, such that in the presence of severe stress those high in self-criticism were less likely to respond to treatment than were those low in self-criticism.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effect of a psychiatric intervention in treating depression (treatment study) and the effect of a psychological treatment in preventing depression (prevention study) after hip fracture in older people. Design: Two linked randomized, controlled trials. Setting: Orthopedic units in Manchester, England. Participants: Two hundred ninety-three older people who had undergone surgery for a fractured hip: 121 in the treatment study and 172 in the prevention study. Measurements: The Geriatric Depression Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for mood, functional tests for mobility and pain measures. Results: There was a slight reduction in depressive symptoms in the active arm of the treatment study. In the prevention study, there was no significant difference in incident depression between the psychological intervention and treatment as usual. There were no differences in the functional and pain outcomes. Conclusion: The results from these two randomized, controlled trials show that, after hip fracture surgery, no statistically significant benefits can be achieved from a psychiatric intervention in people who are depressed or a psychological intervention to prevent the onset of depression.

AB  - Objective: Anxiety is highly comorbid with depression, but little is known about the impact of anxiety disorders on the effectiveness of empirically supported psychotherapies for depression. We examined such outcomes for people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and depression, with versus without comorbid anxiety disorders. Design: Participants with MS (N = 102) received 16 weeks of telephone-administered psychotherapy for depression and were followed for one year post-treatment. Results: Participants with comorbid anxiety disorders improved to a similar degree during treatment as those without anxiety disorders. Outcomes during follow-up were mixed, and thus we divided the anxiety diagnoses into distress and fear disorders. The distress disorder (GAD) was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms during and after treatment. In contrast, fear disorders (i.e., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia) were linked to depression, specifically during follow-up, across 3 different measures. Conclusions: People with GAD receiving treatment for depression may benefit from additional services targeting anxiety more specifically, while those with comorbid fear disorders may benefit from services targeting maintenance of gains after treatment.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing. Methods: We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients’ mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients’ self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks. Results: Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (betaweek = −.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (betaweek = −.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (bweek = −.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (betaweek = −.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58). Conclusions: Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Background: People with chronic depression are frequently lost from effective care, with resulting psychological, physical and social morbidity and considerable social and financial societal costs. This randomised controlled trial will evaluate whether regular structured practice nurse reviews lead to better mental health and social outcomes for these patients and will assess the cost-effectiveness of the structured reviews compared to usual care. The hypothesis is that structured, pro-active care of patients with chronic depression in primary care will lead to a cost-effective improvement in medical and social outcomes when compared with usual general practitioner (GP) care. Methods/Design: Participants were recruited from 42 general practices throughout the United Kingdom. Eligible participants had to have a history of chronic major depression, recurrent major depression or chronic dsythymia confirmed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). They also needed to score 14 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at recruitment. Once consented, participants were randomised to treatment as usual from their general practice (controls) or the practice nurse led intervention. The intervention includes a specially prepared education booklet and a comprehensive baseline assessment of participants’ mood and any associated physical and psycho-social factors, followed by regular 3 monthly reviews by the nurse over the 2 year study period. At these appointments intervention participants’ mood will be reviewed, together with their current pharmacological and psychological treatments and any relevant social factors, with the nurse suggesting possible amendments according to evidence based guidelines. This is a chronic disease management model, similar to that used for other long-term conditions in primary care. The primary outcome is the BDI-II, measured at baseline and 6 monthly by self-complete postal questionnaire. Secondary outcomes collected by self-complete questionnaire at baseline and 2 years include social functioning, quality of life and data for the economic analyses. Health service data will be collected from GP notes for the 24 months before recruitment and the 24 months of the study. Discussion: 558 participants were recruited, 282 to the intervention and 276 to the control arm. The majority were recruited via practice database searches using relevant READ codes.

AB  - This randomized pilot study investigated the effects of meditation with yoga (and psychoeducation) versus group therapy with hypnosis (and psychoeducation) versus psychoeducation alone on diagnostic status and symptom levels among 46 individuals with long-term depressive disorders. Results indicate that significantly more meditation group participants experienced a remission than did controls at 9-month follow-up. Eight hypnosis group participants also experienced a remission, but the difference from controls was not statistically significant. Three control participants, but no meditation or hypnosis participants, developed a new depressive episode during the study, though this difference did not reach statistical significance in any case. Although all groups reported some reduction in symptom levels, they did not differ significantly in that outcome. Overall, these results suggest that these two interventions show promise for treating low- to moderate-level depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Purpose: Patients differ in their response to treatments. There is obvious clinical utility in establishing patient characteristics that are associated with differential treatment responses (i.e. are effect modifiers or moderators of treatment response). Factors that moderate response to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) remain unclear. This study investigates whether factors prognostic of general depression outcome generally are also moderators of response to online CBT in a sample of depressed patients recruited through UK general practices. Methods: Secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial, internet-based psychotherapy for depression. A total of 297 patients referred from 55 UK general practices and suffering from depression were randomly allocated to receive either online CBT or waiting list control. Treatment effect was measured by comparing depression score at 4 months between randomization groups. Treatment effect modification was assessed using regression analyses focusing on interactions between treatment effect and putative moderator variables. Results: Pretreatment severity and marital status moderated treatment response. More severe patients, and patients who were separated, widowed, or divorced, benefited most from the intervention. Weak evidence suggested that treatment effectiveness diminished with increasing recent adverse life events. No evidence was found to suggest that educational attainment, age, and history of depression-moderated treatment response. Conclusions: Secondary analyses of trials comparing two or more treatments allow factors that may moderate treatment response to be distinguished from more general prognostic indicators, although caution is needed in interpreting such exploratory analyses.

AB  - This study examined the explanatory models of depression, perceived relationships between diabetes and depression, and depression treatment experiences of low-income, Spanish-speaking, Hispanics with diabetes and depression. A purposive sample (n = 19) was selected from participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial conducted in Los Angeles, California (United States) testing the effectiveness of a health services quality improvement intervention. Four focus groups followed by 10 in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed using the methodology of coding, consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison, an analytical strategy rooted in grounded theory. Depression was perceived as a serious condition linked to the accumulation of social stressors. Somatic and anxiety-like symptoms and the cultural idiom of nervios were central themes in low-income Hispanics' explanatory models of depression. The perceived reciprocal relationships between diabetes and depression highlighted the multiple pathways by which these two illnesses impact each other and support the integration of diabetes and depression treatments. Concerns about depression treatments included fears about the addictive and harmful properties of antidepressants, worries about taking too many pills, and the stigma attached to taking psychotropic medications. This study provides important insights about the cultural and social dynamics that shape low-income Hispanics' illness and treatment experiences and support the use of patient-centered approaches to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and depression.

AB  - This article reports the development and psychometric properties of two short forms of the 28-item Agnew Relationship Measure, the ARM-12 and ARM-5. For the ARM-12, results of previous research were used together with conceptual considerations to select three items to represent each of four ARM subscales: Bond, Partnership, Confidence, and Openness. For the ARM-5, item-analytic principles were used to select five items to represent overall alliance. In all three ARMs, client and therapist versions were constructed to contain parallel items. We drew data to assess reliability and validity from three UK trials of brief therapy for depression. Results indicated that the two short ARMs have acceptable psychometric properties and that they converged with each other and with the full ARM.
