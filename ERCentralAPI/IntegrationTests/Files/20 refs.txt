AB  - The development and clinical trial of a 5-session behavioral intervention for complicated bereavement (CB) is presented. We conceptualized CB in terms of Major Depression (MDD) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and consequently applied treatment components of Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE). In order to assure standardization of treatment, control costs, and engage patients, a multi-media, multi-context format was adopted to address avoidance and withdrawal behaviors conceptualized as central pathogenic responses in CB. Participants (N = 26) were assessed before and after BA-TE treatment via structured clinical interview and standardized questionnaires in terms of PTSD, MDD, CB, and health concerns. The number of days since the death of the loved one was widely variable and served as a covariate for all outcome analyses. ANCOVAS revealed statistically significant improvement, irrespective of how many days since death had elapsed prior to initiation of intervention, on structured interviews and self-report measures for most outcome variables.

AB  - Background: Mobile phone text message technology has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with depression and co-morbid Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Aims: To perform a randomised rater-blinded trial to explore the effects of supportive text messages on mood and abstinence outcomes for patients with depression and co-morbid AUD. Methods: Participants (n=54) with a DSM IV diagnosis of unipolar depression and AUD who completed an in-patient dual diagnosis treatment programme were randomised to receive twice daily supportive text messages (n=26) or a fortnightly thank you text message (n=28) for three months. Primary outcome measures were Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores and Cumulative Abstinence Duration (CAD) in days at three months. Trial registration: NCT0137868. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in three month BDI-II scores between the intervention and control groups; 8.5 (SD=8.0) vs. 16.7 (SD=10.3) respectively after adjusting for the baseline scores, F (1, 49)=9.54, p=0.003, ηp 2=0.17. The mean difference in change BDI-II scores was −7.9 (95% CI −13.06 to −2.76, Cohen's d=0.85). There was a trend for a greater CAD in the text message group than the control group: 88.3 (SD=6.2) vs. 79.3 (SD=24.1), t=1.78, df=48, p=0.08. Limitations: Limitations of the study include the small sample size, the potential for loss of rater blinding and the lack of long term follow-up to determine the longer term effects of the intervention. Conclusion: Supportive text messages have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with comorbid depression and alcohol dependency syndrome.

AB  - Aim of the study was to evaluate mortality and functional, cognitive, affective status in elderly patients (≥75 years) with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or acute congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted to the emergency department (ED) of S. Giovanni Battista Hospital of Torino and randomly assigned to the geriatric home hospitalization service (GHHS) or to a general medical ward (GMW). All patients were evaluated on admission, on discharge and at 6 months, using a standardized study protocol. We excluded patients with unstable medical conditions. The total sample included 73 patients: 35 with COPD exacerbation (19 GHHS, 16 GMW) and 38 with CHF (19 GHHS, 19 GMW). Mean age was 81.7 ± 8.0 years. At baseline, no significant differences in demographic, social and clinical conditions were found between the two groups of patients. 56.7% of COPD patients had a severe exacerbation, according to Anthonisen criteria; 65% of CHF patients were NYHA-III and 35% NYHA-IV (according to the criteria of the New York Heart Association) (FE < 35% in 40% of patients). On admission all patients were partially dependent in ADLs and IADLs, with a moderate impairment of depression score and a fairly good quality of life. On discharge depression score and quality of life were significantly better only in GHHS patients. Mortality was similar in the two setting of care. Patients managed at home had a significantly longer length of treatment. At 6-month follow-up we did not observe a difference in mortality, but we observed a higher readmission rate in patients previously treated in hospital. In conclusion, our study indicates that home-treated patients with COPD or CHF have better depressive scores and quality of life and a lower rate of hospital readmission after six months.

AB  - This article reports on a randomized controlled trial investigating the short-term effectiveness of the Coping With Depression course in a sample of adults seriously at risk of developing major depression. In addition, possible mediating properties of several proximal outcome variables were assessed. Participants (N=110) were adults with subclinical depressive symptoms. They were randomly assigned to either a group course condition, the Coping With Depression course, or an assessment-and-advice-only control group condition. Short-term results measured 1 month after completion of the course reveal that the course is effective in reducing depressive symptoms. The group course condition showed beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, pleasant activities, self-esteem, social skills, social support, and depressive thoughts. Changes in depressive cognition and self-esteem proved to be significant mediators of depressive symptoms. Possible implications for depression prevention are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To assess the efficacy of acupuncture as an intervention for major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Acupuncture was examined in 151 patients with MDD (DSM-IV) who were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups in a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The specific intervention involved traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)-style acupuncture with manual stimulation for depression; the control conditions consisted of (1) a nonspecific intervention using a comparable number of legitimate acupuncture points not specifically targeted to depressive symptoms and (2) a waitlist condition, which involved waiting without intervention for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, all patients received the depression-specific acupuncture. Each 8-week intervention regimen consisted of 12 acupuncture sessions delivered in an acupuncturist's office in the community. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The study was conducted from February 1998 to April 2002. Results: Twenty patients terminated treatment before the completion of the 8-week intervention (13%) but not differentially by study group. Random regression models of the intent-to-treat sample revealed that although patients receiving acupuncture improved more than those awaiting intervention, no evidence of differential efficacy of the depression-specific over nonspecific intervention was found. Response rates in acupuncture-treated patients were relatively low after 8 weeks (22% and 39% for specific and nonspecific intervention groups, respectively), with the response rate after the entire 16-week trial reaching 50%. Conclusion: Although TCM manual acupuncture is a well-tolerated intervention, results fail to support its efficacy as a monotherapy for MDD. It can't be ruled out that factors unique to the implementation of acupuncture in this research study may have limited the efficacy of interventions compared to those provided in naturalistic settings.

AB  - Objective: We designed this study to determine whether the daily treatment of nondepressed acute stroke patients with sertraline reduced the incidence of depression at follow-up. Method: 111 patients with recent stroke (< 2 weeks; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision criteria) were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo (N = 56) and sertraline (N = 55.50 mg once daily) in this double-blind, placebo-controlled 24-week clinical trial. Subjects were recruited from the 2 largest teaching hospitals of Western Australia between June 2002 and June 2004. The primary endpoint of interest was development of clinically significant depressive symptoms as assessed by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale score of 8 or above, or as diagnosed by the treating physician during 24 weeks. Results: There was no significant difference in the incidence of depressive symptoms during 24 weeks of treatment (16.7% [8/48] sertraline vs. 21.6% [11/51] placebo, rate ratio = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.3 to 2.1, p = .590). The trial medication was discontinued by 51.8% (29/56) of patients assigned placebo and 47.3% (26/55) assigned sertraline (p = .634), most often because of perceived side effects or because the treating physician introduced an antidepressant medication. Conclusions: Twenty-four-week treatment with 50 mg of sertraline once daily initiated within 2 weeks of onset of acute stroke is not a significantly more effective strategy to prevent 6-month depression than usual care plus placebo among nondepressed stroke patients. New pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies need to be developed to reduce the health and financial burden associated with depression after stroke.

AB  - The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial is a multi-site effectiveness study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) with the aim of identifying successful, acceptable and cost-effective treatment strategies for outpatients with unremitted depression. With enrollment of 4041 adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), it is the largest controlled psychiatric treatment study ever undertaken. In the course of developing procedures to ensure that ambitious enrollment goals were met, a number of ethical and practical issues became apparent that underscore the conflicts between effectiveness research and human subject protections. These are delineated as they relate to study design; eligibility criteria; incentives to subjects; investigators and clinical sites; the complementary roles of clinical research coordinators (CRCs) and study clinicians; and recruitment and consent procedures. The STAR*D trial exemplifies the interplay and tension between those strategies that integrate research and clinical aims and roles in the service of enhancing external validity, site participation, and recruitment and retention versus those strategies that differentiate research and clinical treatment in the service of research integrity and human subject protections. We hope that a discussion of these key challenges and dilemmas and how they have been addressed will help inform future discussions concerning design and conduct of ethical effectiveness trials designed to optimize care in real world clinical settings.

AB  - Background: There is much interest in whether daily left prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over several weeks may become a clinically useful antidepressant treatment. Although rTMS appears largely safe, many patients report that this procedure is somewhat painful, which may restrict its ultimate appeal and use. We analyzed interim results from the open-label phase of a multisite randomized trial of rTMS as a treatment for depression to investigate whether the procedural pain of left prefrontal rTMS changes over time. Methods: Patients with unipolar depression who had failed to respond during at least 3 weeks of the sham controlled double-masked rTMS were then offered 3 more weeks (15 sessions) of open-label rTMS. Retrospective pain ratings and state emotional factors from 20 subjects were assessed with the use of visual analog scales (VAS) recorded on computers before and after each treatment (289 sessions). Results: Over the 15 treatment sessions, subjective reports of the painfulness of rTMS decreased 48% from baseline. This reduction, although greatest in the first few days, continued steadily (average 2.11 points per session) over the 3 weeks of treatment. The analysis found a significant effect for rTMS-session (P < .0001) on rTMS-procedural pain over and above changes in subjective emotional states. Conclusions: The procedural pain of left, prefrontal rTMS decreases over time, apparently independently of other emotional changes. Because rTMS scalp pain may decline over time, physicians and patients may decide to continue treatment despite initial discomfort. These observational data can be better tested once the data from the blinded phase of the trial becomes available. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Background: Major depression can be treated by means of cognitive-behavioural therapy, but as skilled therapists are in short supply there is a need for self-help approaches. Many individuals with depression use the Internet for discussion of symptoms and to share their experience. Aims: To investigate the effects of an Internet-administered self-help programme including participation in a monitored, web-based discussion group, compared with participation in web-based discussion group only. Method: A randomised controlled trial was conducted to compare the effects of Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy with minimal therapist contact (plus participation in a discussion group) with the effects of participation in a discussion group only. Results: Internet-based therapy with minimal therapist contact, combined with activity in a discussion group, resulted in greater reductions of depressive symptoms compared with activity in a discussion group only (waiting-list control group). At 6 months' follow-up, improvement was maintained to a large extent. Conclusions: Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy should be pursued further as a complement or treatment alternative for mild-to-moderate depression.

AB  - Introduction: Although several adverse effects of antidepressants on the gastrointestinal tract have been described (bleeding, constipation, dolichocolon), their influence on gallbladder motility was not investigated. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of selected antidepressants on gallbladder emptying in patients with major depression. Methods: The study was set up as an open clinical trial, with the same intervention (ingestion of test meal provoking gallbladder emptying) undertaken in 112 patients with major depression. There were 30 patients not taking antidepressants (the control group), 25 patients taking amitriptyline, 30 patients taking maprotiline, and 27 patients taking fluoxetine. The volume of gallbladder in the study patients was measured by ultrasonography before the test meal, and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after the meal. Results: 1 h after ingestion of the study meal, the amitriptyline group showed incomplete gallbladder emptying (F = 10.829, df = 3, p = 0.000; mean residual volume 11.0 ± 6.1 mL), while in the control, maprotiline and fluoxetine groups emptying of gallbladder was complete (mean residual volumes 5.0 ± 3.3 mL, 5.6 ± 3.7 mL and 5.7 ± 2.3 mL, respectively). Discussion: In patients with cholecystitis, it would be wise to use antidepressants which do not impair gallbladder emptying, like maprotiline or fluoxetine, and to avoid amitriptyline.

AB  - Background: Over 50% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) either do not tolerate or do not respond to antidepressant medications. Several preliminary studies have shown the benefits of acupuncture in the treatment of depression. We sought to determine whether a 2-point electroacupuncture protocol (verum acupuncture) would be beneficial for MDD, in comparison to needling at nonchannel scalp points with sham electrostimulation (control acupuncture). Method: Fifty-three subjects aged 18-80 years, recruited via advertisement or referral, were included in the primary analysis of our randomized controlled trial, which was conducted from March 2004 through May 2007 at UPMC Shadyside, Center for Complementary Medicine, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Inclusion criteria were mild or moderate MDD (according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders) and a score of 14 or higher on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Exclusion criteria included severe MDD, seizure disorder or risk for seizure disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, chronic MDD, treatment-resistent MDD, and history of substance abuse in the prior 6 months. Patients were randomized to receive twelve 30-minute sessions of verum versus control acupuncture over 6 to 8 weeks. The HDRS was the primary outcome measure. The UKU Side Effect Rating Scale was used to assess for adverse effects. Results: Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to verum electroacupuncture and 25 to control acupuncture. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to gender, age, or baseline severity of depression. Both groups improved, with mean (SD) absolute HDRS score decreases of -6.6 (5.9) in the verum group and -7.6 (6.6) in the control group, corresponding to 37.5% and 41.3% relative decreases from baseline. There were no serious adverse events associated with either intervention, and endorsement of adverse effects was similar in the 2 groups. Conclusions: We were unable to demonstrate a specific effect of electroacupuncture. Electroacupuncture and control acupuncture were equally well tolerated, and both resulted in similar absolute and relative improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the HDRS.

AB  - The motivation for clinical trials inventory-depression (MCTI-D) was developed and evaluated for assessing motivations to participate in clinical trials on depression. Sixty-four participants completed the MCTI-D: 40 individuals expressing interest in participating in a randomized clinical trial (RCT); and 24 clinic patients receiving traditional care for depression. Content validity was supported by feedback derived from a panel of experts in depression research and respondents completing the measure. The motivation most frequently endorsed for participating in an RCT was the desire to help others and/or to further science. The potential stigma associated with seeing a psychiatrist was reported to have the least influence. Patients expressed a greater likelihood to participate in RCTs that involved psychotherapy than in experimental medication or placebo-controlled trials. Data from the MCTI-D may provide useful information for depression researchers to consider as possible influences on patients' decisions about whether or not they will participate.

AB  - Objective: The combination of chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression is associated with worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone. In this study, we report the predictors of pain intensity and activity interference in primary care patients with co-morbid pain and depression. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of the 250 persons who participated in a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of 12 weeks of optimized antidepressant therapy for both depression and pain. Using multivariate linear regression analysis, we assessed the predictive value of baseline self-efficacy, fear of movement, pain beliefs, and demographic and clinical factors on 3-month Graded Chronic Pain Scale pain intensity and activity interference outcomes. Results: In the full model, significant sociodemographic predictors of less activity interference included being non-white (β -5.8, P = 0.04) and being employed (β -13.3, P < 0.0001). The latter was also predictive of less pain intensity (β -5.6, P = 0.01). As expected, the optimized antidepressant treatment arm was associated with improved outcomes (pain intensity: β -3.7, P = 0.0005 and activity interference: β -6.4, P = 0.01). Whereas stronger perceived pain control (b 3.6, P = 0.01) was associated with greater activity interference, higher degree of fear of movement (or fear avoidance) predicted greater pain intensity (β 0.46, P = 0.04) and activity interference (β 0.57, P = 0.05). Neither the location (low back vs hip/knee) nor duration of pain were predictive of pain intensity or interference outcomes. Conclusion: The findings are consistent with a biopsychosocial model, implicating the need to consider the impact of sociodemographic variables and pain-related beliefs and cognition on pain-related outcomes for patients with co-morbid musculoskeletal pain and depression.

AB  - The role of central sensitization (CS) in clinical pain reported by FMS patients is unclear. In this report, we sought to establish evidence of a prospective association between clinical pain and an objective measure of spinal nociception (nociceptive flexion reflex [NFR] threshold) and explore whether depression moderates this relationship. We collected measures that included the NFR threshold (in the range of 0–60 milliamperes (mA); a lower threshold represents greater nociceptive responsivity) and clinical variables (ie, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)-total, FIQ-pain, depression and current pain intensity) at 3 time points (baseline, weeks 6 and 12). Using linear mixed effects models, clinical variables were treated as time-varying covariates. Across time, current pain intensity [estimate –1.79 mA (.8), P = .03] and the presence of depression [estimate –6.30 mA (3.2), P = .059] were significantly associated with NFR threshold. The interaction of current pain intensity and depression was also significantly associated with NFR threshold. Specifically, the relationship between current pain intensity and NFR threshold was present in the nondepressed group but not in the depressed group (estimate –3.9 versus .07, P = .01). Both FIQ-total and FIQ-pain were not associated with NFR threshold. In conclusion, higher level of clinical pain intensity correlated with greater nociceptive responsivity, and that depression moderated this association. Perspective: Given that clinical pain correlated with nociceptive responsiveness, our findings support the mechanistic role of CS in fibromyalgia. If replicated in larger studies, NFR threshold may serve as a biomarker of clinical pain in nondepressed fibromyalgia patients. Also, our results may have future implication for treatment of FMS with and without comorbid depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - The effect of depression on HIV disease progression was examined among 996 HIV-positive Tanzanian women participating in a trial on micronutrients and pregnancy outcomes, vertical transmission, and disease progression. Depression and social support were measured 2 months after HIV screening and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Depression measures from pregnancy and more than 12 months postpartum were included in this analysis. Participants' clinical condition and access to supportive individual or group counseling was assessed throughout the 6 to 8 years of followup. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the time-varying effect of depression on progression to HIV clinical stage HI/TV (World Health Organization) and all-cause mortality. Participation in group or individual counseling and baseline social support were also examined. More than half (57%) of the study sample had symptoms comparable with depression at least once during the follow-up period. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, psychosocial support, and clinical condition at enrollment, depression was associated with an increased risk of disease progression (HIV clinical stage HI/TV [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28 to 2.03] and mortality [HR = 2.65, 95% CI: 1.89 to 3.71]). Depression is common among HIV-infected Tanzanian women and increases the risk of disease progression. Screening for depression and providing psychosocial interventions should be considered part of comprehensive HIV care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB  - Beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been reported for several psychiatric disorders, particularly for depression. Association studies show a relationship between omega-3 intake and depression risk. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have shown a moderate effect of supplementation on depressive symptoms, but not on normal mood states. Few studies have investigated effects on cognition. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of omega-3 supplements on cognition and mood of recovered depressed individuals. Seventy-one participants were randomized to receive either omega-3 or placebo for four weeks in a randomized double-blind design. Results showed small effects of omega-3 supplementation on aspects of emotional decision-making and on self-reported states of depression and tension. Some of the effects were confounded by learning effects. No significant effects were observed on memory, attention, cognitive reactivity and depressive symptoms. While inconclusive, the present findings may indicate that omega-3 supplementation has selective effects on emotional cognition and mood in recovered depressed participants.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and the effectiveness of a Stepped Care Program (SCP) for preventing relapse of depression in older people. Stepped care consisted of (1) watchful waiting; (2) bibliotherapy; (3) individual cognitive behavioral therapy; and (4) indicated treatment. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, persons 55 years and older (n = 136) who had suffered at least one episode of major depression in the past received a SCP or Care As Usual (CAU). The primary outcome measure was incidence of a new depressive episode. Results: Of 1725 previously depressed persons, 175 were willing to partake in the study, 136 of whom were eligible. Treatment satisfaction for stepped care was high. At 12‐month follow‐up, no difference in incidence of depression between SCP and CAU was found. Medical patient records showed that missing data were often related to relapse. Conclusions: In this study, SCP was not more effective in preventing relapse than CAU. Watchful waiting may harmfully delay actual preventive treatment. Prevention as an integral part of regular treatment might lead to higher participation rates.

AB  - Neuropsychological (NP) impairment is multiply determined among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals who are also dually diagnosed with depression and who use illicit substances. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of HIV status, depression, and problematic substance use on NP performance. A total of 160 opiate-dependent outpatients undergoing methadone maintenance (80 HIV-infected, 80 HIV-uninfected) completed diagnostic and NP evaluations. Raw scores from individual NP tests were converted to Z scores relative to standard norms and were averaged to form a composite score. HIV-infected participants had significantly lower overall NP performance—as well as lower performance on tests of attention, motor speed, and verbal memory—than HIV-uninfected participants. In multiple regression analyses considering the role of depression and substance use, only HIV status emerged as a significant predictor of NP impairment. These findings confirm NP impairment in HIV-infected substance abusing patients independent of comorbid depression and severity of substance use.

AB  - Background: There are significant shortcomings in the management and clinical outcomes of depressed patients. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-component programme to improve the management of depression in primary care. Methods: This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial, conducted between June 2007 and June 2010. Twenty primary care centres were allocated to intervention group or usual care group. The intervention consisted of a multi-component programme with clinical, educational and organizational procedures including primary care nurses working as case-managers. Outcomes were monitored by a blinded interviewer at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Trial registration: ISRCTN16384353, at http://isrctn.org. Results: In total, 338 adult patients with major depression (DSM-IV) were assessed at baseline. At 12 months, 302 patients were assessed, 172 in the intervention group and 130 in the control group. The severity of depression (mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score) was 1.76 points lower in the intervention group [7.15 vs. 8.78, 95% CI = −3.53 to 0.02, p = 0.053]. The treatment response rate was 15.4% higher in the intervention group than in the controls [66.9% vs. 51.5%, odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.1, p=0.011)], and the remission rate was 13.4% higher [48.8% vs. 35.4%, odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1 to 2.9, p = 0.026)]. Limitations: Unblinded physicians diagnosed depression in their patients and decided whether to include them in the study, so we cannot discount a hidden selection bias. Conclusions: The programme for managing depression leads to better clinical outcomes in patients with major depression in primary care settings.

AB  - Although spiritual or religious behaviors are sometimes targeted within behavior activation therapy (Hopko & Lejuez, 2007; Lejuez, Hopko, & Hopko, 2001) the efficacy of a protocol that ideographically assesses and develops a religiously based behavioral repertoire has not been investigated. This randomized study investigated the efficacy of a single-session behavioral activation of religious behaviors (BARB) protocol relative to supportive therapy (ST) among mild to moderately depressed undergraduate students (n = 50). Clinical outcomes assessed depression, anxiety, environmental reward, and quality of life. Results indicated that BARB successfully increased religious behaviors, attitudes, and coping skills at posttreatment. Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that the BARB group also had significantly greater decreases in depression and anxiety, and increased quality of life at posttreatment. At 1-month follow-up, these treatment gains were maintained and 84% or BARB participants reported continued religious activation. Finally, mediation analysis indicated that religious behaviors and attitudes were significant mediators of the relation between treatment condition and attenuation of depression. This study provides encouraging preliminary support for the efficacy of a parsimonious religious-based behavioral activation intervention for depression in college students.
