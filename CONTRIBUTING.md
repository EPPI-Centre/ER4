EPPI Reviewer is not strictly **Free** software and at this time **it is not open to third party contributions**. Inside EPPI Reviewer 6 itself (in all pages) there is a "Feedback" function which is primarily used to receive suggestions about features/changes. Please feel free to use it so to reach our developers and recommend changes (we offer no guarantee about accepting/implementing any suggestion - we can only work on a "best effort" basis).

You can use the same system to signal issues, bugs or any other concern. If you believe your matter is urgent, it is best to send an email to EPPISupport@ucl.ac.uk as we make every effort to ensure someone will always monitor it and it is thus the best way to make sure your query/concern will be acted upon as soon as possible.

Should you ignore the above and attempt to file issues/alerts from within GitHub, please be aware that we do not have systems/procedures set up to monitor and respond to these, so we offer no guarantee we will notice and/or act upon them promptly.
