Eppi Reviewer
(Sergio writing) code provided to experiment with.
Important: current development is happening elsewhere, while we all can experiment with what's in here.
At the EPPI-Centre, we'll be familiarising with GitHub, at NICE, you are free to look at the code, try to see if it build, etc.
You will need my help to make things work, most importantly, you'll need to create two databases "Reviewer" and "ReviewerAdm".
The creation script for the former is in "EPPIReviewer4.2015\Server\Data\generateReviewer.V2.sql", a second file there called "generateReviewer 2nd Passage - DATA.sql". To complete the picture you'd need to also have ReviewerAdm contact me for details.

Once we're done experimenting, I will be placing here the latest code (code is up to date today 17/06/2016) but development is happening still on the repos we have in TFS. For now, this is a playground only.
